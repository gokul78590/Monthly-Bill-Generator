# Monthly-Bill-Generator

Python-based billing logic that consolidates and summarizes itemized billing records by month. It takes a list of individual line items — each representing a charge for a specific item, rate, quantity, and date range — and intelligently groups them based on the item_code, rate, and billing_period. The output includes a structured list of summarized items and total revenue for the selected month.

Core Functionalities:
Data Grouping & Aggregation: Automatically groups line items using composite keys and calculates total quantity and amount.

Date Filtering Logic: Filters entries precisely based on whether their billing period overlaps with the selected month.

JSON I/O Compatibility: Easily extendable to connect with APIs, databases, or real-time data pipelines.

Potential Enhancements for Real-World Systems:
This script lays the groundwork for future development in:

Data Engineering Pipelines: Can be integrated into ETL workflows using Apache Airflow or dbt to automate monthly billing processes for large-scale enterprises.

Machine Learning Applications: Enhancements can include anomaly detection on billing amounts, predictive billing using time series models (ARIMA, LSTM), or customer segmentation based on usage patterns.

Data Science Reporting: Can feed into visualization tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Plotly Dash to produce executive-level billing dashboards.

Cloud-Scale Deployment: Could be containerized using Docker and deployed with serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for real-time billing systems.
